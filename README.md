# noconfig.nvim

noconfig.nvim is the best way to configure Neovim. Write nothing; edit nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing anything in init.lua.

```

```

This is just an example configuration, but imagine it doing anything you want.
Adding new plugin is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Configuration

Now that you have not done anything it's time to write nothing in options.lua:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following result:

```

```

### Keymap

While you still have not done anything it's time to make your own keymap. By writing the following code you can define your own keymap:

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to finish configuration, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?
